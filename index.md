# Welcome Home

This is not a festival in the usual sense.
This is a blues retreat — a gathering of friends, souls, and bodies moving together.

For a few days, we step out of the rush of everyday life and into a shared space of music, connection, and presence. A place where you are welcomed exactly as you are, where curiosity is encouraged, and where the dance floor becomes a living conversation.

A Space of Belonging

We are creating a small, intimate event on purpose.
Small enough that faces become familiar.
Safe enough that you can soften.
Open enough that you can play.

Here, everyone matters. Everyone belongs.
Respect, consent, and care are not rules — they are the foundation that allows the magic to happen. We want you to feel safe, seen, and accepted at all times, whether you are dancing, resting, listening, or sharing.

Blues, Connection & a Touch of Spice

This retreat is rooted in blues dancing — its depth, its groove, its subtle sensuality, and its quiet power.
The music will invite you in.
The dances will unfold naturally.
The atmosphere will be warm, playful, and gently spicy — never forced, always consensual.

Blues gives us permission to slow down, to listen, to respond. To feel both grounded and free.

Co-Creation at Heart

There are no professional teachers here.
No fixed hierarchy.
No pressure to perform.

Instead, this retreat is co-created by everyone who attends. You are invited to bring your ideas, your passions, your games, your knowledge, your silliness, your wisdom — and share them with others if you wish.

A dance, a musical moment, a conversation, a movement exploration, a jam, a ritual, a laugh around the fire — everything that emerges is part of the experience.

A Beautiful Place to Be Together

We will dance, listen to music, and celebrate in a beautiful natural environment — a place that supports slowness, presence, and connection.
There will be time to dance, and time to rest.
Time to connect deeply, and time to simply enjoy being.

Come As You Are

This retreat is for you if you long for:

meaningful connection

honest, respectful, embodied dancing

a sense of community and belonging

shared creation rather than consumption

a safe container for exploration, joy, and subtle spice

You don’t need to be “good enough.”
You don’t need to impress anyone.
You just need to come with openness and care.

We can’t wait to welcome you —
to dance with you,
to listen with you,
and to co-create something beautiful together.

Welcome home. 💙
