## Welcome Home

This is not a festival in the usual sense.
This is _Blues Playground_, a gathering of friends, souls, and bodies moving together.

For a few days, we step out of the rush of everyday life and into a shared space of music, connection, and presence. A place where you are welcomed exactly as you are, where curiosity is encouraged, and where the dance floor becomes a living conversation.

### A Space of Belonging

We are creating a small, intimate event on purpose.
Small enough that faces become familiar.
Safe enough that you can soften.
Open enough that you can play.

Here, everyone matters. Everyone belongs.
Respect, consent, and care are not rules. They are the foundation that allows the magic to happen. We want you to feel safe, seen, and accepted at all times, whether you are dancing, resting, listening, or sharing.

The atmosphere will be warm and playful, with a touch of spice that emerges through listening, presence, and shared consent.

### Co-Creation at Heart

There are no teaching roles here.
No fixed hierarchy.
No pressure to perform.

This Blues Playground is co-created by everyone who attends. You are invited to bring your ideas, your passions, your games, your knowledge, your silliness, your wisdom and share them with others if you wish.

A dance, a musical moment, a conversation, a movement exploration, a jam, a ritual, a laugh. Everything that emerges is part of the experience.

You don’t need to be “good enough.”
You don’t need to impress anyone.
You just need to come with openness and care.

We can’t wait to welcome you
to dance with you,
to listen with you,
and to co-create something beautiful together.

Welcome home. 💙
