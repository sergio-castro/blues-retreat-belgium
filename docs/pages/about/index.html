        <p>Open Blues Belgium is a non-profit do-it-yourself event. The main organisers deal with renting the venue, registrations, scheduling and logistics, but workshops, activities, decoration, safer space is crowdsourced!</p>
<p>Why don’t we follow the usual workshop format and invite some star teachers and separate beginner to advanced dancers?</p>
<p>There's already enough blues events like this. Creating together, sharing meals &amp; eating at the same venue will allow us to create a nice, cozy community.</p>
<p>Whatever your dance passion is, it's welcome if you think it might enrich the community. You can request a very limited time frame (e.g. 30 minutes) or a bigger workshop (e.g. 90 minutes), you can lead it on your own or with your friends, with instruments or without, you can create a space for experimentation or give a traditional class...</p>
