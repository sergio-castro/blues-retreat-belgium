        <h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Whatever your dance passion is, it's welcome if you think it might enrich the community. You can request a very limited time frame (e.g. 30 minutes) or a bigger workshop (e.g. 60 minutes). Longer workshops can also be negotiated if slots available.
You can lead it on your own or with your friends, with instruments or without, you can create a space for experimentation or give a traditional class...</p>
<p>There is only one catch: all proposed activities must be somehow linked to Blues.</p>
<p>We really encourage you to share something. Is this what wil determine the success of this event.
Once you register you will be able propose a topic, indicating its duration, max number of participants and anything else you need to tell us.</p>
<p>Note that participants will have a choice to register to the activities they want, so make the description appealing and inviting.</p>
<h2>Live Music &amp; Parties</h2>
<p>Three great bands will play on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings.
On Sunday, the music will be provided by a DJ.</p>
