Blues Playground is a non-profit do-it-yourself event. The main organisers deal with renting the venue, registrations, scheduling and logistics, but workshops, activities, decoration, safer space is crowdsourced! 

Why don’t we follow the usual workshop format, invite teachers and separate beginner to advanced dancers?

There's already enough blues events like this. Creating together, sharing meals & sleeping at the same venue will allow us to create a nice, cozy community.
