Open Blues Belgium is a non-profit do-it-yourself event. The main organisers deal with renting the venue, registrations, scheduling and logistics, but workshops, activities, decoration, safer space is crowdsourced! 

Why don’t we follow the usual workshop format and invite some star teachers and separate beginner to advanced dancers?

There's already enough blues events like this. Creating together, sharing meals & eating at the same venue will allow us to create a nice, cozy community.

Whatever your dance passion is, it's welcome if you think it might enrich the community. You can request a very limited time frame (e.g. 30 minutes) or a bigger workshop (e.g. 90 minutes), you can lead it on your own or with your friends, with instruments or without, you can create a space for experimentation or give a traditional class...
